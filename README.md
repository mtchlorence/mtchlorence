# 👋 Hey, I'm Mitch!

Welcome to my GitHub! 🌱  
I’m someone who loves exploring, experimenting, and learning how data and cloud systems connect behind the scenes.

### 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

🧠 Expanding my knowledge in:
- ☁️ **AWS Services & Platform Tools** → Glue, Athena, Lambda, CloudWatch, S3  
- ⚙️ **Automation & Scripting** → Python, Bash, and small daily efficiency hacks  
- 🧩 **Data Quality & Lineage** → building trust through better data visibility  
- 🔍 **Monitoring & Observability** → keeping systems healthy and transparent  
- 📊 **Data Visualization** → turning raw data into clear, meaningful insights

### 💡 My Learning Style

I learn best by:
- 🧪 Building small experiments to test ideas  
- 📚 Reading docs and diving into “how things really work”  
- 🧠 Breaking things (then fixing them again 😅)  
- ✍️ Writing down what I’ve learned to remember it better  
- 🐶 Taking short “paw-ses” with my dogs — they’re the best debugging partners ever
